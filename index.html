                but now, it is popular as an essential ability as well as an added
                advantage for many job profiles.

                for programming community Computer programming is important today
                because so much of our world is automated. Humans need to be able to
                control the interaction between people and machines. Since computers
                and machines are able to do things so efficiently and accurately, we
                use computer programming to harness that computing power.
